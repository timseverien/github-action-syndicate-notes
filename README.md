## Obtaining integration secrets

All integrations require some keys to work.

Make sure to store variables as secrets ‚Äî you do not want these to be made public. See [Creating secrets for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).
